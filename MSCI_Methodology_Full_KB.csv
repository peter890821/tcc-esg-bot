MSCI.COM | ESG RATINGS METHODOLOGY MSCI ESG RESEARCH LLC 1 Methodology overview 1.1 Objective MSCI ESG Ratings provide an opinion of companies’ management of financially relevant ESG risks and opportunities. Each rating takes into consideration the company’s exposure to potentially material ESG risks, the quality of management systems and governance structures to mitigate potential ESG risks, and where applicable, positioning to meet market demand for the provision of products and services that have a positive environmental or social contribution. For additional details on the definition of rating scales, refer to the “MSCI ESG and Climate Symbols and Definitions” document. 1.1"

For additional details on the definition of rating scales, refer to the “MSCI ESG and Climate Symbols and Definitions” document. 1.1.1 Key features • MSCI ESG Ratings are industry-relative measures and are determined at the company level. Ratings are on a global seven-band scale from AAA (the highest ESG Rating) to CCC (the lowest ESG Rating). • Each company is evaluated on a selection of two to seven Environmental and Social Key Issues (out of 33 total Key Issues, see Exhibit 1). The Environmental and Social Key Issues relevant for a given company are selected based on the company’s exposure to potentially material ESG risks, which are driven by industry-specific and market-specific factors. • All companies are evaluated on the Governance Pillar, which is comprised of six Key Issues in the Corporate Governance and Corporate Behavior Themes. The evaluation is based on the gap between best practice and each company’s governance practices"

MSCI.COM | ESG RATINGS METHODOLOGY MSCI ESG RESEARCH LLC 3 Methodological steps 3.1 ESG Key Issues 3.1.1 Determining ESG Key Issues The research process begins with an in-depth assessment of the ESG risks and opportunities that are relevant to each industry. There are 27 Environmental and Social Key Issues, and industries are evaluated on a selection of two to seven of these key issues. Key Issue selection is based on an annual review of underlying data and review by analytical staff. This process is explained in more detail below. Universal Key Issues All companies in all industries are evaluated on the Key Issues under the Governance Pillar, with six governance Key Issues evaluated across two Themes: Corporate Governance and Corporate Behavior (See Section 3.4.5, Determining Governance Scores, for the slightly different treatment of supranationals and development banks)"
MSCI ESG Ratings Methodology.pdf,Methodology_General,26,".4.5, Determining Governance Scores, for the slightly different treatment of supranationals and development banks). This is based on MSCI ESG Research’s view that governance is universally important and should be evaluated in an integrated way, regardless of industry. Setting industry Key Issues ESG Key Issues are selected for each of the 163 sub-industries defined by the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS®).2 The Environmental and Social Key Issues vary between industries and are selected based on the extent to which the business activities of the companies in each industry generate large environmentalor social-related externalities. The steps are as follows: • For each company, reported business segments are mapped to a standard business activity. MSCI ESG Research uses the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) system along with industry-specific adjustments to define business activities"
MSCI ESG Ratings Methodology.pdf,Methodology_General,27,". MSCI ESG Research uses the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) system along with industry-specific adjustments to define business activities. • Each business activity is assessed on the level of externality generated for each ESG Key Issue to derive a Business Segment Exposure Score. • For instance, MSCI ESG Research measures the externality for the Health and Safety Key Issue based on the extent to which companies’ business segments are prone to injuries and fatalities. The data is based on industry statistics from the International Labour Organization (ILO) and health and safety authorities such as the Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA). • For a company operating underground coal mines (SIC 1222), the average fatality rate per 1,000 employees is 0.45; for a company operating surface coal mines (SIC 1221), the average fatality rate per 1,000 employees is 0.13. These metrics are converted into a 0-10 score, based on the relative ranking of industry intensities"
MSCI ESG Ratings Methodology.pdf,Methodology_General,28,".13. These metrics are converted into a 0-10 score, based on the relative ranking of industry intensities. • Each company’s overall Business Exposure Score is the weighted average of the Segment Exposure Scores of a company’s business segments, weighted by the percentage of sales, 2 GICS is the global industry classification standard jointly developed by MSCI and S&P Global Market Intelligence. © 2024 MSCI Inc.

This constitutes the company’s Business Segment Exposure score. • MSCI ESG Research ranks all 163 GICS sub-industries on each Key Issue based on the average ESG Business Segment Risk Exposure score of the underlying companies"
MSCI ESG Ratings Methodology.pdf,Methodology_General,29,". • MSCI ESG Research ranks all 163 GICS sub-industries on each Key Issue based on the average ESG Business Segment Risk Exposure score of the underlying companies. The example shown in Appendix 2: Example of industry Key Issue selection illustrates how the carbon intensity of each GICS sub-industry is used to determine whether the Carbon Emissions Key Issue should be considered an industry Key Issue. Typically, MSCI ESG Research will propose changes to industry Key Issues based on the following: • The addition of an ESG Key Issue for a GICS sub-industry when the size of the externality (based on the average Business Exposure Score of the companies in that sub-industry) is at or exceeds the 80th percentile of all sub-industries and the average Business Exposure Segment Risk Exposure score is greater than or equal to 5.0"

In Q4 of each calendar year, MSCI ESG Research institutes a 30-day client consultation and comment period during which feedback is solicited on proposed changes to the industry Key Issues. Company-Specific Key Issues In some cases, a company may face a unique Environmental or Social Key Issue that is not shared by other companies in its industry. This can arise from several scenarios, ranging from companies with unique or diversified business models to subsets of companies within an industry that face a unique set of risks (see Exhibit 7). In these cases, a Company-Specific Key Issue is added to the analysis and the weights on the remaining Key Issues are reduced proportionally"

Each Environmental and Social Key Issue typically comprises 5% to 30% of the total ESG Rating"
MSCI ESG Ratings Methodology.pdf,Methodology_General,37,". Each Environmental and Social Key Issue typically comprises 5% to 30% of the total ESG Rating. The weights for these Key Issues are determined for each GICS sub-industry based on the sub-industry’s contribution to the negative externality associated with the Key Issue and the expected time horizon for the Key Issue to materialize, as illustrated conceptually in Exhibit 8, below. For the Governance Pillar, the weight is set at the Pillar level rather than at the key issue level. The Governance Pillar weight is determined for all sub-industries assuming a “High Contribution/Long Term” and “Medium Contribution/Long Term” assessment on Corporate Governance and Corporate Behavior, respectively.3 Additionally, the weight on the Governance Pillar is floored at a minimum value of 33%"
MSCI ESG Ratings Methodology.pdf,Methodology_General,38,".3 Additionally, the weight on the Governance Pillar is floored at a minimum value of 33%. Company-specific Key Issues and weights are permitted, subject to committee approval, for companies with diversified business models, facing controversies or based on predefined rules that apply to certain industries. Key Issues and weights undergo a formal review and feedback process at the end of each calendar year. Exhibit 8: Framework for setting Key Issue weights Short-term time Long-term time frame for frame for Risk/Opportunity Risk/Opportunity to Materialize to Materialize (<2 years) (5+ years) Industry is a major contributor to environmental or Highest Weight social impact Industry is a minor contributor to environmental or Lowest Weight social impact The framework is such that a Key Issue defined as “High-Impact” and “Short-Term” would be weighted three times higher than a Key Issue defined as “Low-Impact” and “Long-Term"
MSCI ESG Ratings Methodology.pdf,Methodology_General,39,".” • Level of contribution to social or environmental externality: In the process outlined above, each GICS sub-industry is assigned a “High,” “Medium,” or “Low” impact for each Key Issue, based on MSCI ESG Research’s analysis of relevant data (e.g., average carbon emissions 3 In cases where the Corporate Governance Score cannot be calculated for the Governance Reference Entity due to insufficient disclosure, the Governance Pillar Score is calculated solely by reference to the Corporate Behavior Key Issue. © 2024 MSCI Inc.

For Key Issues where the primary risk materializes via an event such as a controversy, MSCI ESG Research looks at the severity of the controversies to determine the level of contribution to the Environmental or Social externality"
MSCI ESG Ratings Methodology.pdf,Methodology_General,40,". For instance, occurrence of severe/very severe controversies is viewed as having a high level of contribution to the concerned externality. Conversely, occurrence of minor controversies is viewed as having a low level of contribution to the concerned externality. Conversely, if many companies in an industry are observed to experience severe controversies in an area, then the level of contribution is determined to be High. At the same time, if many companies in an industry are observed to experience minor or no controversies in an area, then the level of contribution is determined to be Low. Expected time horizon of risk/opportunity: The time horizon of each Key Issue o (Short-Term, Medium-Term, Long-Term) is classified based on the type of risk or opportunity that each Key Issue presents to companies"
MSCI ESG Ratings Methodology.pdf,Methodology_General,41,". Each Key Issue is assigned a baseline time horizon (for example, depending on o whether the risk is driven by pending regulations versus a slower time horizon issue, such as consumer demand shift). In some cases, the time horizon of a single Key Issue can vary between industries o (for example, Labor Management is defined as a Medium-Term issue when its relevance is to general worker productivity but is considered Short-Term in industries where labor disruptions and stoppages are very common). The final set of Key Issues and accompanying weights must be approved by the sector team leader and the ESG Methodology Committee before the research process progresses. Weights are set at the beginning of the calendar year and apply throughout that year. Please see Appendix 3: Weight-setting framework for further information on this process. 3.1"
MSCI ESG Ratings Methodology.pdf,Methodology_General,42,". Weights are set at the beginning of the calendar year and apply throughout that year. Please see Appendix 3: Weight-setting framework for further information on this process. 3.1.3 Key Issue assessments Depending on the nature of the Key Issue, one of three evaluation approaches is undertaken: • Risk Key Issues: A Risk Exposure Score and a Risk Management Score are combined such that a higher level of exposure requires a higher level of demonstrated management capability in order to achieve the same overall Key Issue Score.

Conversely, the model does not penalize companies with minimal risk management strategies if they face low or minimal exposure to the specific risk. For Key Issues that assess opportunities rather than risk, MSCI ESG Research evaluates each company’s exposure to assess the relevance of those particular business opportunities for a given company. 3.2"
MSCI ESG Ratings Methodology.pdf,Methodology_General,45,". 3.2.1 ESG Risk Exposure model MSCI ESG Research’s assessment of risk exposure may comprise three different areas of analysis, depending on the Key Issue: • Business Risk Exposure — analyzes the breakdown of a company’s business in terms of revenue, assets or operations. • Geographic Risk Exposure — analyzes the breakdown of a company’s geographic segments in terms of revenue, assets or operations. • Company-Level Risk Exposure factors — such as number of employees, size, reliance on government contracts or reliance on outsourced production. Business Exposure is a weighted average of the Business Segment Exposure Scores of a company’s business segments, adjusted for the proportion of total assets or revenue for which each segment accounts. The Business Segment Exposure score measures the extent of the externality generated by each business activity (for example, the carbon emissions generated per dollar of revenue by cement production)"
MSCI ESG Ratings Methodology.pdf,Methodology_General,46,". MSCI ESG Research uses the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) system along with industryspecific adjustments to define business activities. In some industries where SIC-based industries lack sufficient granularity for an accurate ESG risk assessment, MSCI ESG Research creates business activities that more accurately represent a company’s lines of business (see Exhibit 9). 4 For Raw-Material Sourcing, risk exposure and risk management are assessed at a more granular material level (timber/paper, beef/dairy, seafood/aquaculture, palm oil, cotton, leather). For Corporate Governance (Ownership & Control, Board, Pay, Accounting) a different scoring approach is applied. See Section 3.5.4: Calculating Governance Scores, below © 2024 MSCI Inc.

The 0-10 score is calculated in the following steps: 1. Weighted average Business Exposure Score, based on 0-10 Business Exposure Scores for each business line weighted by percentage of assets, percentage of revenue or percentage of operations; 2. Combined with company-specific factors, if applicable (e.g., size of workforce, percentage outsourced, etc.); and 3. Multiplied by geographic multiplier, if applicable.

As part of the qualitative indication of a company’s performance on an ESG Key Issue, MSCI ESG Research incorporates information on controversies in which a company has been implicated. 3.3.2 Controversies cases MSCI ESG Research has a dedicated team of ESG analytical personnel who identify and assess on an ongoing basis the severity of controversy cases that involve companies in the ratings universe. A controversy case is defined as an instance or ongoing situation in which company operations and/or products allegedly have a negative environmental, social and/or governance impact. Cases include alleged company violations of existing laws and/or regulations to which they are subject; or an alleged company action or event that violates commonly accepted international norms, including but not limited to norms represented by global conventions such as the United Nations (UN) Global Compact"
MSCI ESG Ratings Methodology.pdf,Methodology_General,56,". A case is typically a single event such as a spill, accident or regulatory action, or a set of closely linked events or allegations such as health and safety fines at the same facility, multiple allegations of anticompetitive behavior related to the same product line, multiple community protests at the same company location or multiple individual lawsuits alleging the same type of discrimination. Each controversy case is assessed for the severity of its impact on society or the environment and consequently rated Very Severe (reserved for “worst of the worst” cases), Severe, Moderate or Minor. To reach these assessments, each case is analyzed along two dimensions. • The nature of harm, on a scale ranging from Very Serious to Minimal harm. • The scale of impact, on a scale ranging from Extremely Widespread to Low impact"

These may include deliberate obstruction of investigations, attempts to cover up the event or activity or the punishment or termination of employees voicing their concerns or participating in protests against the company. • Cases that meet the criteria for exacerbating circumstances may have a final assessment that is more severe than the initial severity assessment derived from the nature and scale of impact alone. As events unfold or additional information becomes available, the severity of a given case may be reassessed as warranted"
MSCI ESG Ratings Methodology.pdf,Methodology_General,61,". As events unfold or additional information becomes available, the severity of a given case may be reassessed as warranted. Selective incorporation of controversies into the ESG Rating Model While every controversy case may signal reputational risk, not every controversy is judged to pose material risks; therefore, not every controversy affects the company’s overall rating. MSCI ESG Ratings typically assess whether the controversy case indicates structural problems with a company’s risk management capabilities. In the ESG Rating methodology, a controversy case that is deemed by ESG analytical personnel to indicate structural problems that could pose future material risks for the company triggers a larger deduction from the Key Issue Score than a controversy case that is deemed to be an important indicator of recent performance but not a clear signal of future material risk"
MSCI ESG Ratings Methodology.pdf,Methodology_General,62,". Conversely, if a case is brought to the ESG Ratings Methodology Committee as per predefined criteria, ESG analytical personnel can propose to exclude a controversy case from the risk management assessment when a controversy case has been addressed by a company’s management practices and deemed unlikely to pose future material risk to the company. 3.3.3 Standardization and benchmarking A key component of the analytical process is to standardize the data that ESG data experts collect with an aim to accurately gauge companies’ risk management capabilities. Example: ESG data experts collect historical data on health and safety rates, which are often not comparable in terms of the units reported or the scope covered (e.g., statistics cover © 2024 MSCI Inc. All rights reserved. Please refer to the disclaimer at the end of this document.

MSCI ESG Ratings Methodology.pdf,Methodology_General,63,". MSCI.COM | ESG RATINGS METHODOLOGY MSCI ESG RESEARCH LLC contractors versus employees only, or joint ventures versus wholly owned subsidiaries only). ESG data experts normalize data across companies that report differently with an aim to allow uniform industry benchmarking. Analyzing the targets that companies commit to on a Key Issue, such as targets on reducing water consumption in response to operational risks arising from Water Stress, is another example of where ESG analytical personnel compare the strength of companies’ commitments. While the indicators used to score companies on each Key Issue are standardized across industries that face the same Key Issue, which facilitates comparisons across industries on each Key Issue, ESG analytical personnel delve into industry-specific or region-specific information where possible when scoring the indicators with a goal to capture the risks and opportunities companies face in each industry"
MSCI ESG Ratings Methodology.pdf,Methodology_General,64,". Example: Biodiversity & Land Use Key Issue metric: “To what extent do companies minimize disturbances from operations?” In MSCI ESG Research’s Oil & Gas research, ESG data experts collect data on the total barrels of oil spilled and the intensity of the spills (barrels spilled per USD sales); ESG analytical personnel rank the results on oil spills, which are then translated into 0-10 scores for this metric in the Key Issue model. 3.3.4 Variations in disclosure While the ESG Rating model and analysis process encompasses in-depth analysis of industryspecific data and Key Issues, MSCI ESG Research’s ratings methodology has also been designed to accommodate large variations in norms of disclosure, including low to almost no ESG disclosure among companies that are smaller in market capitalization, operate in less environmentally intensive industries, and/or in regions newly aware of ESG Key Issues, without overly penalizing lack of disclosure"
MSCI ESG Ratings Methodology.pdf,Methodology_General,65,". The structure of the model is such that half of the contribution of Environmental and Social Key Issues to the overall ESG Rating comes from an assessment of a company’s Risk Exposure. Because company-level inputs required for MSCI ESG Research’s assessment of Risk Exposure come from standard financial disclosure, typically, no modification in the model is necessary to accommodate companies with lower ESG disclosure. For the Risk Management assessment, where analysis is more reliant on ESG-specific company disclosure, MSCI ESG Research has identified, through testing, a set of baseline indicators that meet the dual criteria of being most often disclosed and most likely to differentiate companies from industry peers on Risk Management capabilities on each Key Issue. Where there is no company disclosure on an indicator falling into the Performance category of Risk Management, the ESG Ratings analytical approach does not assume that the company’s performance category is “worst"
MSCI ESG Ratings Methodology.pdf,Methodology_General,66,".” Instead, the methodology assigns a performance level that is below average in the industry context. Example: In the Health & Safety Key Issue, data experts collect extensive data points on injury and fatality rates that can be used to discern performance trends. Analysis of this data is used to calculate a score for the indicator: “Rate the company’s performance on the above metrics (injury and fatality statistics), in the context of its industry peers?” © 2024 MSCI Inc. All rights reserved. Please refer to the disclaimer at the end of this document. MSCI.COM | ESG RATINGS METHODOLOGY MSCI ESG RESEARCH LLC A score of 0 indicates worst performance in the industry context, while a score of 10 indicates best performance in the industry context. When lack of disclosure on injury or fatality rates prevents a rigorous performance analysis, the model assigns a score of 3 out of 10"
MSCI ESG Ratings Methodology.pdf,Methodology_General,67,". When lack of disclosure on injury or fatality rates prevents a rigorous performance analysis, the model assigns a score of 3 out of 10. Where there is no company disclosure on an indicator falling into the Initiatives category of Risk Management on a Key Issue, the ESG Ratings analytical approach depends on where the company has the bulk of its operations and whether risk management initiatives for the Key Issue in question are common. Example: In the Biodiversity & Land Use Key Issue, ESG analytical personnel assess companies’ efforts to minimize disturbances from their operations. For companies that operate primarily in highly regulated markets but lack disclosure on minimizing environmental disturbance, MSCI ESG Research assumes they met at least a basic standard, leading to a score of 3 out of 10. The existence of mitigation efforts is not assumed for companies mainly operating in markets with limited environmental protections and enforcement"
MSCI ESG Ratings Methodology.pdf,Methodology_General,68,". The existence of mitigation efforts is not assumed for companies mainly operating in markets with limited environmental protections and enforcement. Example: In contrast, in the case of Supply Chain Labor Standards Key Issue, MSCI ESG Research assumes that the lack of disclosure of an explicit Code of Conduct for suppliers indicates that the company may not have such a policy in place, thereby raising the risks of poor labor standards in its supply chain that can lead to operational disruptions and reputational damage. When a company’s lack of disclosure on specific Key Issues leads to uncertainty in assessing its performance relative to peers, the ESG Ratings company report explicitly points out this uncertainty in assessing the company’s performance. In certain cases, MSCI ESG Research uses estimates when a company-disclosed figure is not available"
MSCI ESG Ratings Methodology.pdf,Methodology_General,69,". In certain cases, MSCI ESG Research uses estimates when a company-disclosed figure is not available. Estimates are typically derived from industry averages, regional criteria and extrapolation from company disclosures to derive more granular values. 3.3.5 Determining Management Scores In the Environmental and Social Pillars, management scores ranging from 0 to 10 are calculated for each Key Issue, indicating a company’s strategy, programs and proven track record on this Key Issue. The 0-10 score is calculated in the following steps: • Each underlying indicator collected is transformed into a 0-10 score, where 10 indicates best practice and 0 indicates a lack of management. • Scores are equally weighted within each management category. For example, if three indicators are assessed to determine a company’s Strategy, then these three indicators are equally weighted in determining a Strategy Score"

For example, if three indicators are assessed to determine a company’s Strategy, then these three indicators are equally weighted in determining a Strategy Score. • Category-level scores are equally weighted to determine an overall management score, before taking Controversies into account. For most Key Issues, Management Score is determined as a simple average of practices (typically comprising indicators related to strategy, policies, programs, initiatives and targets) and performance (including indicators related to performance trends vis-à-vis prior years and vis-à-vis industry peers). © 2024 MSCI Inc.

Environmental and social risks are typically industry-specific (certain Key Issues only matter for certain types of companies) and a company’s risk management strategy is evaluated in the context of its exposure to the environmental or social risk under consideration"
MSCI ESG Ratings Methodology.pdf,Methodology_General,72,". In contrast, the two Themes under the Governance Pillar, Corporate Governance and Corporate Behavior, are relevant to all companies. While some governance risks are universal, others may differ based on ownership structure, the dynamics between key stakeholders, and cultural aspects, as well as the evolution of investor protections in the relevant market. Because Corporate Governance and Corporate Behavior are universally relevant and closely intertwined, governance is assessed through an approach that quantifies the gap between a company’s governance practices and what is considered best practice, and identifies the governance risks faced by its investors. A deduction-based scoring model is applied, whereby each company starts with a perfect 10 score and scoring deductions are applied based on the assessment of the Key Metrics. 3.4.1 Key Metrics Key Metrics are the foundational unit of the corporate governance scoring model"
MSCI ESG Ratings Methodology.pdf,Methodology_General,73,". 3.4.1 Key Metrics Key Metrics are the foundational unit of the corporate governance scoring model. Each Governance Key Metric evaluates a specific aspect of a company’s corporate governance risk profile. A Key Metric may signify the presence of a certain type of ownership structure or governance risk factor, or the absence of a policy or practice that is seen as mitigating pertinent governance risks. Key Metric flags are pass/fail evaluations that help users of ESG Ratings understand which Key Metrics are influencing a company’s Theme Score or Key Issue Scores. In data feeds and in MSCI’s Screener tool, these flags are presented as 0 or 1 values, with 1 indicating that the Key Metric is flagged. While some Key Metrics will be flagged for very few companies, others will be flagged for many companies. This allows the scoring model to isolate both leaders and laggards and present a score distribution across the full 0-10 range. © 2024 MSCI Inc. All rights reserved"

The Key Metric Points are converted into a Score Contribution, which is published. 3.4.2 Controversies and events A controversy case is defined as an instance or ongoing situation in which company operations and/or products allegedly have a negative environmental, social and/or governance impact. Other cases may not be classed as being controversial but may provide relevant insights into a company’s governance risk profile"
MSCI ESG Ratings Methodology.pdf,Methodology_General,75,". Other cases may not be classed as being controversial but may provide relevant insights into a company’s governance risk profile. Examples of such events might be breaches or waivers of debt covenants, the ability to meet continuing obligations in relation to a listing of securities, or goodwill write-downs that might raise concerns over the quality of past board decisions. Certain Key Metrics are controversyor event-based. Some of these Key Metrics apply score deductions that vary based on the severity of the controversy evaluation or based on certain thresholds being met by the event. 3.4.3 Standardization and benchmarking A key component of the analytical process is to standardize the data that data experts collect with an aim of gauging companies’ governance risks. Example: The independence of directors is assessed based on a standardized set of evaluation criteria that are applied globally"
MSCI ESG Ratings Methodology.pdf,Methodology_General,76,". Example: The independence of directors is assessed based on a standardized set of evaluation criteria that are applied globally. While these standards may differ from those applied in a given market, this approach offers more comparability across boards. Peer-based Key Metrics use standardized data to generate rules-based peer groups for comparison and evaluation. Example: The evaluation of CEO Pay uses a standardized methodology for calculating total pay figures and a standardized set of rules for peer group construction, both of which are set out in the individual Key Issue methodology document devoted to the Pay Key Issue. 3.4.4 Variations in disclosure Disclosure practices vary depending on jurisdictions of incorporation or regulation, securities listings and other factors"
MSCI ESG Ratings Methodology.pdf,Methodology_General,77,". 3.4.4 Variations in disclosure Disclosure practices vary depending on jurisdictions of incorporation or regulation, securities listings and other factors. MSCI ESG Research assesses instances of nondisclosure based on the significance of that disclosure to the scoring model and based on the significance of that disclosure to an understanding of the company’s corporate governance risk profile. Specifically: • Board members: If the company’s board members are not disclosed, no Corporate Governance Theme Score is published. This reflects the importance of an assessment of the board to the scoring model. • Governance policies and practices: If the company has not disclosed whether a given policy exists or whether the board has adopted a given practice, MSCI ESG Research assumes that the policy or practice does not exist and/or has not been adopted"
MSCI ESG Ratings Methodology.pdf,Methodology_General,78,". Example: If a company has not disclosed whether it has adopted a clawback policy that applies to its shortand long-term incentive pay, this nondisclosure will be interpreted as the absence of a clawback policy. The company would therefore be flagged under the Clawbacks & Malus Key Metric. © 2024 MSCI Inc. All rights reserved. Please refer to the disclaimer at the end of this document. MSCI.COM | ESG RATINGS METHODOLOGY MSCI ESG RESEARCH LLC • Quantitative data: If the company has not disclosed quantitative data used to calculate a Key Metric’s score, MSCI ESG Research may apply a mid-range score deduction based on the potential range of score deductions under that Key Metric. Example: The Auditor Tenure Key Metric provides a variable score based on the disclosed tenure of the company’s auditor. Where the auditor’s tenure is not disclosed, a default nondisclosure deduction is applied"
MSCI ESG Ratings Methodology.pdf,Methodology_General,79,". Where the auditor’s tenure is not disclosed, a default nondisclosure deduction is applied. The value of this deduction is set at 50% of the deduction that would apply for an auditor having served for longer than 20 years. • Jurisdictional defaults: Some items are scored based on mandatory rules within the company’s jurisdiction of incorporation and/or relating to the company’s securities listings. Example: In markets outside the U.S., the “Shareholder Rights to Convene a Special Meeting” Key Metric is based on the minimum standard set out in the applicable company law, unless there is explicit evidence in the governing documents of a more permissive threshold being applied. 3.4.5 Determining Governance Scores Key Metrics Key Metrics are the foundational unit of the governance assessment. Each Key Metric evaluates a specific aspect of a company’s governance risk profile and provides a simple pass/fail evaluation"
MSCI ESG Ratings Methodology.pdf,Methodology_General,80,". Each Key Metric evaluates a specific aspect of a company’s governance risk profile and provides a simple pass/fail evaluation. When the metric result is a “fail” evaluation, the Key Metric is “flagged.” Some Key Metrics are relevant only to companies with specific governance characteristics stemming from ownership type, management structure or other factors. Key Metric Points For each Key Metric, MSCI ESG Research calculates a points value that is used in the calculation of the Key Issue and Theme Scores. The Key Metric Points are converted into a Score Contribution, which is published. A higher Score Contribution generally signals more-significant governance risk. Key Issues Each Key Metric is assigned a Category and organized into Key Issues. Each Key Issue represents a broad area of governance risk. For each Key Issue, an absolute score is provided. Key Issue Scores range from 0 to 10, with lower scores indicating more severe risk"

Key Issue Scores range from 0 to 10, with lower scores indicating more severe risk. Corporate Governance and Corporate Behavior Theme Scores The Key Metric points across all Key Issues are used to calculate the Theme Scores. Theme Scores range from 0 to 10, with lower scores indicating more severe risk. Governance Pillar Score The Governance Pillar Score is an absolute assessment of a company’s overall governance that uses a universally applied 0-10 scale. A similar approach is taken to the calculation of the Theme Scores, except that the Key Metric points assigned across all Key Issues in all Themes are used to calculate the Pillar Score. © 2024 MSCI Inc.

MSCI ESG Ratings Methodology.pdf,Methodology_General,83,". The scoring model has the following additional features: • In order to avoid situations in which a company would receive a very high overall Key Issue Score solely as a result of low exposure to that Key Issue, the model requires a minimum management threshold in order to achieve an overall Key Issue Score greater than 5 (see zone where Exposure score is 0-2 in Exhibit 12). • Furthermore, at very high levels of exposure, the maximum possible Key Issue Score a company can achieve is lower than 10, indicating that regardless of a company’s actions or programs to mitigate risk, a certain level of risk persists.

MSCI ESG Ratings Methodology.pdf,Methodology_General,85,". A high level of exposure permits a wider range of outcomes, whereas a low level of exposure constrains the score closer to a value of 5 (see Exhibit 13 below). Exhibit 13: Combining Exposure and Management – opportunities Key Issues The reasoning is that, at higher levels of exposure, companies have more to gain from exploiting the opportunity, but they also have more to lose from a competitive standpoint if they fail to capitalize on the opportunity. At low levels of exposure, MSCI ESG Research judges the immediate opportunities the company faces to be less material; however, strong management systems, product innovation or R&D programs may indicate a stronger capacity to take advantage of future opportunities and a competitive advantage for the firm.

Governance scoring steps 1. Each Key Metric is evaluated with a points value, ranging from 0 to the maximum possible points value for that Key Metric. The calculation of the overarching Theme and Key Issue Scores is based on these points values,6 which vary with Key Metric type, specifically: a. Some Key Metrics assess quantitative data or a range of possible assessment outcomes to determine the applicable points value within a defined range. b. Other Key Metrics, when flagged, always result in the allocation of a stated points value – that is, they output either zero or a defined points value allocated to that Key Metric, with no variation in between. 2. Each Key Issue’s points value is calculated as the sum of the Key Metric points values under that Key Issue (after application of any category-based caps). 3"

The 0-10 Governance Pillar Score is calculated by applying a score conversion formula (see Exhibit 15 below) to the Pillar points value. Negative 0-10 scores are not permitted; therefore, where the Pillar points value is above the Maximum Value, a 0.0 score is assigned. 6. The 0-10 Theme Scores are calculated by applying the score conversion formula set against the Theme points value. Negative 0-10 scores are not permitted; therefore, where the Theme points value exceeds the Maximum Value,8 a 0.0 score is assigned. 7"

Using these inputs, the Score Contribution (deduction) attributable to a given Key Metric is calculated as: • Corporate Governance: (Key Metric Points/Theme Points) * (10 - Theme Score) * -1. 9 The sum of the Theme Maximum Values is not equal to the Governance Pillar Maximum Value by design.

Thus, it is possible for a company to have a lower Governance Pillar Score than either its Corporate Behavior or Corporate Governance Theme Score. This also holds true at the Theme level, where the Corporate Governance Theme Score can be less than all four of the underlying Key Issue Scores (Board, Pay, Ownership, and Accounting). This is demonstrated in Exhibit 19, where the hypothetical company’s Governance Pillar Score (0.4) is less than its Corporate Behavior Score (4.3) and Corporate Governance Score (0.6). The sum of the Corporate Behavior Raw Score (28.5) and the Corporate Governance Raw Score (94) results in a Governance Pillar Raw Score (122.5) that is closer to the Maximum Value (128) than either of the underlying Themes are to their respective Maximum Values (50 and 100, respectively). © 2024 MSCI Inc.

MSCI.COM | ESG RATINGS METHODOLOGY MSCI ESG RESEARCH LLC Appendix 5: Normalizing the Weighted Average Score vs. industry peers As set out in section 3.6 above, each company receives a Preliminary Industry-Adjusted Score (IAS), where the WAKIS is normalized based on score ranges set by the benchmark values in the peer set. Industry peer set benchmark values The following criteria in setting the industry top and bottom benchmark values applied starting November 2020: • The top benchmark value (“industry maximum score”) falls between the 95th and 100th percentile of modeled WAKIS within an ESG Rating Industry. • The bottom benchmark value (“industry minimum score”) falls between the 0th and 5th percentile of modeled WAKIS within an ESG Rating Industry. Percentiles were calculated based on the full universe of companies with ESG Ratings (10,052 companies) as of March 13, 2024"
MSCI ESG Ratings Methodology.pdf,Methodology_General,128,". Percentiles were calculated based on the full universe of companies with ESG Ratings (10,052 companies) as of March 13, 2024. The MSCI ESG Ratings coverage universe continually expands to include new companies, which are often companies with low disclosures. Sometimes, such companies can distort the bottom benchmark value by lowering it, thereby leading to upgrades for the rest of the companies in the industry. For such industries, this problem is mitigated by excluding recent coverage additions (companies with less than two years of ratings history) while determining the bottom five percentile range for the WAKIS. These values are set at the beginning of a year based on the distribution of the WAKIS of an industry until that point in time. However, the distribution of the WAKIS in an industry is expected to change during the year with new disclosures and improvements in the ESG performance of companies, resulting in unidirectional movement of rating changes in an industry"
MSCI ESG Ratings Methodology.pdf,Methodology_General,129,". Consequently, the industry maximum and minimum scores for each ESG Rating Industry were selected within the aforementioned percentile ranges to meet the following objectives: 1. Minimize unidirectional changes in ESG Ratings. 2. Ensure that the selected industry minimum and maximum scores with respect to its current industry minimum and maximum scores are moving in the direction of the underlying score distribution. Exceptions to the 95th and 5th percentile boundaries If adherence to these boundaries results in strong unidirectional modeled rating changes (upgrade/downgrade ratio beyond 0.7 to 1.3) thereby working against objective 1 or 2 above, the range can be extended to the 90th and 10th percentile of modeled WAKIS for the industry minimum and maximum values, respectively"
MSCI ESG Ratings Methodology.pdf,Methodology_General,130,".7 to 1.3) thereby working against objective 1 or 2 above, the range can be extended to the 90th and 10th percentile of modeled WAKIS for the industry minimum and maximum values, respectively. However, the range of the industry minimum and maximum values will only be extended to the 10th and 90th percentiles if the resulting ESG Rating distribution entails less unidirectional movement than would otherwise be achieved by keeping the minimum and maximum values constant. © 2024 MSCI Inc. All rights reserved. Please refer to the disclaimer at the end of this document. MSCI.COM | ESG RATINGS METHODOLOGY MSCI ESG RESEARCH LLC Industry minimum and maximum scores update frequency The benchmark values are reviewed at least once a year. They are updated within a year if either of the following conditions are met: • If there is a drift in the WAKI score distribution: the mean WAKIS and/or either of the tails are changing by ≥0.2 since the last review"
MSCI ESG Ratings Methodology.pdf,Methodology_General,131,".2 since the last review. • If either of the min-max boundaries are breached: The current industry maximum score being less than 90th percentile and/or the current industry minimum score being greater than the 10th percentile of the latest distribution of WAKIS (i.e., beyond a 5% buffer around the aforementioned ranges). The resulting industry minimum and maximum scores can be accessed in the drill-down section of each company’s ESG Rating report. The adjusted score of 10 is defined at or above the industry maximum score, and the adjusted score of 0 is defined at or below the industry minimum score"
MSCI ESG Ratings Methodology.pdf,Methodology_General,132,". The adjusted score of 10 is defined at or above the industry maximum score, and the adjusted score of 0 is defined at or below the industry minimum score. The remaining companies’ scores are linearly interpolated based on these values using the following formula: ind_adj_score= 10*(weighted_avg_score-industry_min_score)/(industry_max_score-industry_min_score) (constrained 0-10, rounded to one decimal) MSCI ESG Research reviews these benchmark values on an annual basis to reflect changes to underlying company data, methodology updates and fluctuations in industry peer sets. The relation between the Weighted Average Score and the Industry Adjusted Score is shown in Exhibit 20, below. For instance, if the score distribution in an industry is such that the industry minimum and maximum scores are 2.9 and 8.1, respectively (on a scale of 0-10), these are given a score of 0 and 10 respectively in the Industry Adjusted Scale (IAS)"

MSCI ESG Ratings Methodology.pdf,Methodology_General,135,". The allocation of a company’s peers for assessing executive pay also references a company’s Home Market. Companies are classified into countries as set out in the MSCI Country Classification Standard, with Home Markets reviewed annually in October and any changes effective starting Jan. 1.13 Determining Home-Market allocation Countries with 30 or more companies in governance coverage as of Oct. 1 each year will be allocated their own Home Market for the following calendar year. A Home Market will be deemed to have insufficient companies when it falls to 25 companies in governance coverage or, subject to review by the Corporate Governance Methodology Committee, where it has fewer than 30 companies for two successive years. Countries with insufficient companies will be allocated a Home Market for the following calendar year that is formed based on: • MSCI’s Markets Classification (Developed, Emerging, Frontier); and • Geographical Regions (EMEA, Asia Pacific, Americas)"
MSCI ESG Ratings Methodology.pdf,Methodology_General,136,". If for any combination of Market Classification and Region, there are still not at least 30 companies, pairings may be combined to form an aggregated grouping that makes the minimum size criterion for Home Markets. If the combination of Markets Classification and Geographical Region results in insufficient companies for a Home Market for any of the pairings, the Home Market will be formed based on the Market Classification only. Ad hoc coverage additions Companies added to coverage outside of the Annual Review will be assigned one of the Home Markets effective at the time of the coverage addition based on the company’s MSCI Country Classification. If an equity issuer has no MSCI Country Classification, and the country of incorporation and the country of the primary listing of the security are the same, then that country is used.

MSCI.COM | Introduction This document provides essential information on the components of the Tax Transparency Key Issue to enable users of ESG Ratings to understand how our outputs are determined. Tax Transparency is a Key Issue in the Governance Pillar of the MSCI ESG Ratings model. Companies are evaluated on their estimated corporate tax gap (see below), revenue-reporting transparency and their involvement in taxrelated controversies. A company’s estimated tax gap will only affect its 0-10 Corporate Behavior Theme Score and its 0-10 Governance Pillar Score when it is involved in an ongoing taxrelated controversy"
MSCI ESG Ratings Methodology - Tax Transparency Key Issue.pdf,Methodology_Tax_Transparency,2,". A company’s estimated tax gap will only affect its 0-10 Corporate Behavior Theme Score and its 0-10 Governance Pillar Score when it is involved in an ongoing taxrelated controversy. Because the estimated tax gap is an approximation and does not consider the unique circumstances of a company’s tax structure, ongoing tax controversies are used to improve the level of conviction in an estimated negative tax gap.

Ownership & Control is a Key Issue in the Governance Pillar of the MSCI ESG Ratings model
MSCI ESG Ratings Methodology - Ownership & Control Key Issue.pdf,Methodology_Ownership_&_Control,6,". Ownership & Control is a Key Issue in the Governance Pillar of the MSCI ESG Ratings model. Companies are evaluated on the ownership structure, the proportionality between the economic exposure and voting power of the largest owner (“control skew”) and other capital or ownership factors that may affect governance risk. Companies are also evaluated on investor protection, in particular the rights of shareholders and the effectiveness of the framework to hold boards to account and the regulatory and company-specific provisions that support (or restrict) shareholders’ ability to determine the company’s future. For additional details on the MSCI ESG Ratings Model, refer to Section 2, Data, ratings and scores, of “ESG Ratings Methodology"

MSCI ESG Ratings Methodology - Ownership & Control Key Issue.pdf,Methodology_Ownership_&_Control,9,". Companies are distinguished by the type of issuer, indicated by the scope of each Key Metric below. Key Metrics Category: Ownership Structure Controlling Shareholder Key Metric Definition Does any shareholder or shareholder bloc control more than 30% of the voting shares, or is able to elect more than 50% of the company’s board? Flagged if yes. Where the Governance Reference Entity is not an equity issuer, this evaluation is based on the ultimate owner. Scope: All issuers Typical Scoring Contribution: 01 1 This Key Metric adjusts the scoring for the following Key Metrics: Related-Party Transactions (if Controlling Shareholder Concerns is flagged and there are RPTs with the controlling shareholder); Independent Board Majority; Significant Votes Against Directors. The following Key Metrics can only be flagged if a Controlling Shareholder is present: Controlling Shareholder Concerns; Cumulative Voting. © 2024 MSCI Inc. All rights reserved"

Please refer to the disclaimer at the end of this document. MSCI.COM | METHODOLOGY DOCUMENT MSCI ESG RESEARCH LLC Controlling Shareholder Concerns Key Metric Definition Does the company’s ownership structure or governance arrangements indicate special concerns for minority public shareholders? Flagged if yes. This can be triggered by the presence of one or more criteria, including where: • Any of the following Key Metrics are also flagged:  No Independent Directors; Leadership Concerns; Undersized Board; Cross Shareholdings; or Poison Pill. • Or any of the following apply:  The issuer has issued golden shares;  The issuer is controlled via a stock pyramid;  The issuer is incorporated as a Partnership Limited by Shares; or  The largest shareholder holds more than 75% of the total voting rights"
MSCI ESG Ratings Methodology - Ownership & Control Key Issue.pdf,Methodology_Ownership_&_Control,11,". Scope: All issuers Typical Scoring Contribution: 1.0 Dispersed Ownership Concerns Key Metric Definition Is the company so widely held that there are no principal shareholders or other large-bloc holders? Flagged if yes. This test eliminates family or founder firms, companies with a 10% or greater principal shareholder, and companies where the aggregate 5%+ holdings exceed 30%. This metric is intended to capture companies where there is a disconnect between ownership and management. In the absence of the constraining influence of informed and involved bloc holders, there is a greater risk of the CEO and board asserting a degree of power and authority more commonly associated with controlled companies. Scope: All issuers Typical Scoring Contribution: 0.2 Cross-Shareholdings Key Metric Definition Is the company involved in a series of cross-shareholdings with other (related or unrelated) companies? © 2024 MSCI Inc. All rights reserved"
MSCI ESG Ratings Methodology - Ownership & Control Key Issue.pdf,Methodology_Ownership_&_Control,12,".2 Cross-Shareholdings Key Metric Definition Is the company involved in a series of cross-shareholdings with other (related or unrelated) companies? © 2024 MSCI Inc. All rights reserved. Please refer to the disclaimer at the end of this document. MSCI.COM | METHODOLOGY DOCUMENT MSCI ESG RESEARCH LLC Flagged if yes. This metric is intended to capture cross-shareholdings intended for non-investment purposes. Crossshareholdings for the purpose of this Key Metric include direct, indirect (via subsidiary companies), circular or more complex cross-shareholding networks. Scope: All issuers Typical Scoring Contribution: Variable, based on size of cross-shareholdings: Range: 0.2 to 3.2 Average: 0.628 Tracking Stock Key Metric Definition Is the company being traded as a tracking stock or similar trading-based entity? Flagged if yes. Tracking stocks are treated as an indicator of potential governance weakness. Scope: All issuers Typical Scoring Contribution: 0"
MSCI ESG Ratings Methodology - Ownership & Control Key Issue.pdf,Methodology_Ownership_&_Control,13,". Tracking stocks are treated as an indicator of potential governance weakness. Scope: All issuers Typical Scoring Contribution: 0.5 Variable Interest Entities Key Metric Definition Does at least 5% of the group's revenue come from VIEs where the company holds less than 10% voting rights? Flagged if yes. A variable interest entity (VIE) is a special purpose vehicle in which the issuer holds a controlling interest in an operating company that is not based on a majority of the voting rights. Via structured contracts, the issuer is typically the primary beneficiary of the VIE. Scope: All issuers Typical Scoring Contribution: 0.5 Category: One Share, One Vote Multiple Equity Classes with Different Voting Rights Key Metric Definition Has the company issued more than one class of equity shares and do these classes carry unequal voting rights? © 2024 MSCI Inc.

MSCI ESG Ratings Methodology - Ownership & Control Key Issue.pdf,Methodology_Ownership_&_Control,14,". All rights reserved. Please refer to the disclaimer at the end of this document. MSCI.COM | METHODOLOGY DOCUMENT MSCI ESG RESEARCH LLC Flagged if yes. The inequality in the voting rights may be manifested via different votes per share, different votes per unit of nominal value or through the ability to vote only on certain matters, or on the election of certain directors, or grant special rights (such as the exclusive right of nominating directors). When a share class termed as “preference,” “preferred” or similar, is classified in the annual accounts under accounting standards as an equity security rather than a liability, then it will be considered as an equity class for the purposes of this metric. Share classes that do not carry special rights but have unequal voting rights may not be flagged if the number issued is not significant"
MSCI ESG Ratings Methodology - Ownership & Control Key Issue.pdf,Methodology_Ownership_&_Control,15,". Share classes that do not carry special rights but have unequal voting rights may not be flagged if the number issued is not significant. Scope: All issuers Typical Scoring Contribution: Variable, based on size of voting rights differential & percentage of votes held by largest owner: Range: 0.2 to 0.6 Average: 0.483 Single Equity Class with Different Voting Rights Key Metric Definition Does the capital structure include a single share class where the voting rights vary based on the duration of ownership (or extra voting rights are granted via “loyalty shares”)? Flagged if yes. In some literature these may also be referred to as tenured voting shares. Scope: All issuers Typical Scoring Contribution: Variable, based on length of required holding period and percentage of votes held by largest owner. Range: 0.2 to 0.55 Average: 0"
MSCI ESG Ratings Methodology - Ownership & Control Key Issue.pdf,Methodology_Ownership_&_Control,16,". Scope: All issuers Typical Scoring Contribution: Variable, based on length of required holding period and percentage of votes held by largest owner. Range: 0.2 to 0.55 Average: 0.397 Voting Rights Limits Shares Held Key Metric Definition Are voting rights capped at a certain percentage, no matter how many shares the investor owns? Flagged if yes.

MSCI.COM | METHODOLOGY DOCUMENT MSCI ESG RESEARCH LLC Ownership Structure Assessment The ownership structure of a company is evaluated along three axes. The first dimension of ownership assessment is the level of control asserted by the largest owner. Principal-agent concerns are primarily applicable to widely held companies with highly dispersed ownership. For closely held companies, however, governance risk is primarily a function of the identity and degree of control wielded by a company’s dominant shareholder. The ultimate owner is the focus of our assessments where stock pyramids are present and in our assessment of the ownership structure of private companies. Exhibit 22: Largest Owner Classification Classification Description Controlling Largest shareholder or shareholder group holds 30% or more of the voting rights"
MSCI ESG Ratings Methodology - Ownership & Control Key Issue.pdf,Methodology_Ownership_&_Control,35,". Exhibit 22: Largest Owner Classification Classification Description Controlling Largest shareholder or shareholder group holds 30% or more of the voting rights. Principal Largest shareholder or shareholder group holds between 10% and 30% of the voting rights. Widely Held No shareholder or shareholder group holds more than 10% of the voting rights. The second dimension of the ownership assessment focuses on the background and motivations of the dominant owner, which might be a company founder or family descendants, state or corporate owner. Exhibit 33: Key Owner Types Classification Description Founder The founder/s of the company play an active role in the company – e.g., serves as chair and/or CEO, is a director or senior executive, is a current shareholder (regardless of the size of their shareholding). Family Family holds 10% or more of the voting rights and maintains at least one board seat. State State directly or indirectly controls 10% or more of the voting rights"

Corporate Issuer is a subsidiary (50% or more of the voting rights) of a Parent corporate, which itself may be listed. 2 Where a shareholding is not directly held by the state, the intent behind the holding is reviewed. A holding by a government holding company for strategic investments will generally result in a state ownership classification, whereas holding by a pension plan for government employees that is managed by independent trustees will not. © 2024 MSCI Inc.

Exhibit 44: Control Skew Classification Description Stock Pyramid Control is exercised through a chain of controlled companies – each of which is also typically listed – that ultimately results in a shareholder gaining voting power that is misaligned with its economic interest. Such a structure allows the top-level shareholder to exercise control (holding at least 30% of the total voting rights) through each level of the pyramid, and to maintain control of the issuer despite having a relatively small entitlement to cash flows"

Multiple Equity Multiple equity classes with unequal voting rights typically fall Classes with into the following main types: Unequal Voting • Different votes per share;3 Rights • Different votes per unit of nominal value; and • Different class rights in the election of directors or other special rights.

MSCI.COM | METHODOLOGY DOCUMENT MSCI ESG RESEARCH LLC Introduction This document provides essential information on the components of the Board Key Issue to enable users of ESG Ratings to understand how our outputs are determined. Board is a Key Issue in the Governance Pillar of the MSCI ESG Ratings model. Companies are evaluated on the board’s independence from management and/or other interests, and on various measures of board experience and effectiveness such as director attendance and director overboarding, where individual board members may compromise their effectiveness by serving on too many boards"
MSCI ESG Ratings Methodology - Board Key Issue.pdf,Methodology_Board,10,". Negative governance-related events such as bankruptcies; securities violations or regulatory investigations; and delisting threats are included in this section. These event metrics, when flagged, may have a significant impact on a company’s overall governance score. For additional details on the MSCI ESG Ratings Model, refer to Section 2, Data, ratings and scores, of “ESG Ratings Methodology"
